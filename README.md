Project Description: E-Learning Platform UI
This project outlines the front-end design and development of a modern, interactive e-learning platform. The goal is to create a user-friendly and engaging multi-page interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean aesthetic and intuitive navigation. This platform will serve as a comprehensive demonstration of front-end skills, including responsive design, dynamic content rendering, and user state management.

The application will be structured as a multi-page interface to logically separate its core functionalities. Key pages will include:

Dashboard/Home: This will be the user's main landing page after logging in. It will provide a personalized overview, featuring currently enrolled courses, progress summaries, and recommendations for new courses.

Course Listing Page: A browsable catalog of all available courses. Each course will be presented in a card format, displaying its title, a brief description, the instructor, and rating. Users will be able to filter and search for courses based on category or keyword.

Course Detail Page: This page will offer in-depth information about a specific course, including a detailed syllabus, instructor bio, student reviews, and an enrollment button. It will also feature an embedded video player for a course preview.

Lesson/Player Page: The core learning environment where users will watch course videos, access supplementary materials (like articles or code files), and navigate between lessons in the course module.

Key features to be implemented include:

Progress Tracking: The UI will visually represent the user's progress through a course. This will be shown on the dashboard and within each course, with indicators like progress bars and checkmarks for completed lessons.

Interactive Video Player: The platform will embed videos for lessons. The interface will include standard player controls and a sidebar for easy navigation through the course curriculum without leaving the player view.

Responsive Design: A critical requirement is that the entire platform must be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing and interaction experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures that learning can happen anywhere, on any device.

The final deliverable will be a visually polished and highly interactive front-end prototype that effectively simulates the experience of a real-world e-learning platform, showcasing a strong understanding of user interface design and front-end development principles.
